The data folder dataComplete12142014 has well over 30,000 files. This is why it has been zipped. Please unzip locally or use the trimmed folder data_trimmed for data.
These files contain the data for the d3 scripts we have used. To use, locally you will need to rename the folder to data.

On the current website indec.html is the forward facing page.
indextest.html has historically been used to pre-test shortly before making changes to index.html
